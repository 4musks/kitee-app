### Project Problem Statement:
- Have you ever wanted to run a survey to validate your next billion dollar startup idea?
- How would you build a form and share it with potential customers?
- How would you collect responses that help you build insights?
- Do you want to build forms that people would like answering?
- Do you want to build forms in less time so that you can dedicate more time on the things that matter to you (your startup)?


### Proposed Solution/Project Idea:

- Here comes Kitee, a simple and intuitive no-code form builder.
- Kite with an extra “e” helps you to soar much higher than a Kite.
- Kitee helps you to create forms and surveys in under 2 mins that people would like answering.
- Kitee is a web application where a user can sign up and quickly start creating their first form, publish it to the world with a shareable public link and collect responses on the fly. Everything built into a single platform, Kitee acts as your control center for creating forms without writing a single line of code.
- Kitee is a SaaS (Software as a Service) offering where customers can buy subscriptions and will be billed on a metered basis, for example - $19/month to publish up to 3 forms with a maximum of 100 responses each.
